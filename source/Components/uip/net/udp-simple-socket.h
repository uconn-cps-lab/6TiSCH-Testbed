/**
 * \brief      Open a UDP socket connection
 * \param c    A pointer to the struct udp_simple_socket that should be connected
 * \param remote_addr The IP address of the remote host, or NULL if the UDP socket should only be connected to a specific port
 * \param remote_port The UDP port number, in host byte order, to which the UDP socket should be connected
 * \param local_port The UDP port number, in host byte order, to bind the UDP socket to
 * \param ptr  An opaque pointer that will be passed to callbacks
 * \param receive_callback A function pointer to the callback function that will be called when data arrives
 * \retval -1  Opening the UDP socket failed
 * \retval 1   Opening the UDP socket succeeded
 *
 *             This function connects the UDP socket to a specific
 *             remote port and optional remote IP address. When a UDP
 *             socket is connected to a remote port and address, it
 *             will only receive packets that are sent from the remote
 *             port and address. When sending data over a connected
 *             UDP socket, the data will be sent to the connected
 *             remote address.
 *
 *             A UDP socket can be connected to a remote port, but not
 *             a remote IP address, by providing a NULL parameter as
 *             the remote_addr parameter. This lets the UDP socket
 *             receive data from any IP address on the specified port. 
 *             The same happens if we specify the remote port 0.
 *
 *             This function also binds the UDP socket to a local port so
 *             that it will begin to receive data that arrives on the
 *             specified port. A UDP socket will receive data
 *             addressed to the specified port number on any IP
 *             address of the host.
 *
 *             A UDP socket that is bound to a local port will use
 *             this port number as a source port in outgoing UDP
 *             messages. If the local_port value UIP_UDP_LISTEN_ALL_PORT (0xFFFF)
 *             is used, all ports are listened by this socket.
 *
 *             The receive_callback will be called when data arrives for the
 *             socket and the ptr data will be available.
